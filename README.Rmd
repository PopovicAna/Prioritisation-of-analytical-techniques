## Introduction
The risk and harm posed by illicit drugs is ever-growing, which highlights the need for law enforcement, forensic science and health agencies to work collaboratively to combat the supply and demand of these drugs. Forensic science provides a means of determining the presence and quantity of illicit substances in specimens by extracting different drug profile types. These drug profile types are extracted using analytical techniques such as gas chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry (**GCMS**), isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (**IRMS**) and capillary electrophoresis (**CE**), to name a few [1]. Collectively these profile types provide a very accurate representation of a drug specimen. However, many questions have been raised recently by law enforcement and the judicial system regarding the determination of an association or similarity between drug specimens, to identify patterns or trends across them [2]. 

One issue with answering these questions is that it is often time consuming to extract different drug profile types from specimens. For this reason, this research focused on prioritising one analytical technique used for extracting drug profiles (i.e. GCMS, IRMS or CE) and use it to determine the level of similarity between specimens. To determine the level of similarity between profiles, different comparison metrics (**CM**) are commonly applied to pre-treated (**PT**) data [3]. 

The analytical technique that should be prioritised should be able to produce the lowest false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) rates when it comes to determining the similarity between **linked** (specimens from the same seizure) and **unlinked** (specimens from different seizures) specimens, see Figure 1 for an example. To clarify, optimising the combination of CMs and PTs will ensure the greatest separation between linked and unlinked populations, in turn minimising FP and FN specimen linkages for each profile type. These measures need to be compared across profile types to determine which one exhibits the greatest discrimination between linked and unlinked specimens.

*Figure 1: An example of the distribution of linked and unlinked specimen scores; orientation of linked and unlinked populations may vary with the comparison metric used*

To quantify the extent of FPs and FNs for each profile type, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (**AUC ROC**) is calculated for multiple combinations of PT and CM. The optimal combination of PT and CM will produce the largest AUC ROC (i.e. closest to 1). The optimal combination of PT and CM is compared across analytical techniques to determine which technique provides the most discrimination between illicit drug profiles, hence allowing techniques to be prioritised based on their level of discrimination power, see Figure 2.

## Usage  
The following code reads in simulated data (*original data cannot be disseminated*) for illicit drug specimens, which have been profiled through several analytical techniques. The code then performs a target variable selection, runs various PTs and CMs, and takes into account different rules for defining specimen populations (PR).

#### **Reading in the data and basic tidying:**
```{r, message=FALSE}
#Load the required libraries
library(openxlsx)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggcorrplot)
library(pROC)
library(ggh4x)

#Importing the Lookup table (contains data about Specimens (i.e. Seizure, Date, Purity, Precursor, etc.)
Lookup <-  read.xlsx("Data/Profiles.xlsx", sheet = "Lookup", rowNames = F, colNames = T, detectDates = T)

#Importing Gas Chromatpgraphy Mass Spectometry data
GCMS <-  as.data.frame(read.xlsx("Data/Profiles.xlsx", sheet = "GCMS", rowNames = T, colNames = T))

#Importing Isotopic Ratio Mass Spectrometry data
IRMS <-  as.data.frame(read.xlsx("Data/Profiles.xlsx", sheet = "IRMS", rowNames = T, colNames = T))

#Importing Capillary Electrophoresis data
CE <- as.data.frame(read.xlsx("Data/Profiles.xlsx", sheet = "CE", rowNames = T, colNames = T))
```

#### **Choosing target variables for GCMS profiles:**
Not all variables contribute equally to the GCMS specimen profiles and should be removed if they are deemed to be redundant. This was achieved through applying the following criteria; optimal target variables (1) must be present in most specimens at a sufficient concentration; (2)  must have a small intra-variability for specimens within seizures and large inter-variability for specimens between seizures; (3) should be uncorrelated to each other [4]. As the IRMS and CE datasets contained 3 and 2 variables respectively, it was decided to not reduce these datasets any further. **Only the GCMS dataset was subject to variable reduction.** 


**(1) Presence of variables in all specimens**  
The presence of variables in each specimen needs to be identified as it common for these variables not to be detected [4], whether that be due to the limit of detection of the analytical instrument or the target variable simply being absent. As shown in Figure 3, all variables were present in more than 25% of specimens meaning that none of the variables are redundant with respect to this criterion.
```{r}
#Bar plot of target variables presence in specimens
Count <- data.frame(Variables = colnames(GCMS),
                    Percentage = round((colSums(GCMS !=0)/nrow(GCMS)), digits = 5),
                    row.names = NULL)

Bar <- ggplot(Count, aes(Variables, Percentage*100)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_light()+
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(face="bold",size = 12,margin=margin(10,0,0,0)),
        axis.title.y = element_text(face="bold",size = 12,margin=margin(0,10,0,0)),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, vjust = 0.5),
        panel.grid = element_blank(),
        panel.background=element_rect(fill=NA),
        legend.position = "none")+
  scale_y_continuous("Percentage of specimens (%)")  +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,100))
Bar  
```

*Figure 3: Presence of variables in GCMS specimens*


**(2) Intra-variability and inter-variability of variables**  
As well as assessing the presence of variables in specimens, the intra- and inter-variability was evaluated. Box plots were selected as the visualisation method to support interpretation of the data. Several larger seizures were selected to visualise the intra-variability, they can be seen in Figure 4. The inter-variability is represented by single specimen seizures assumed to be unlinked to each other. 
```{r, fig.dim=c(5,8)}
Specimen_List <- data.frame(row.names = rownames(GCMS))
Specimen_List$Group <- Lookup$Group[match(row.names(Specimen_List),Lookup$Specimen)]
Specimen_List$Count <- plyr::count(Specimen_List,"Group")$freq[match(Specimen_List$Group,plyr::count(Specimen_List,"Group")$Group)]

Lkd <- lapply(c("G_158","G_030","G_162","G_285"),function(SG){
  X = stack(subset(GCMS, row.names(GCMS) %in% row.names(Specimen_List[Specimen_List$Group==SG,])))
  X$Group = rep(SG,nrow(X))
  return(X)
})
ULkd <-  stack(subset(GCMS, row.names(GCMS) %in% row.names(Specimen_List[Specimen_List$Count==1,])))
ULkd$Group <- rep("Multiple",nrow(ULkd))
Group.labs <- c("Inter-variability",
                "Intra-variability of Group B",
                "Intra-variability of Group A",
                "Intra-variability of Group C",
                "Intra-variability of Group D")
names(Group.labs) <- c("Multiple","G_158","G_030","G_162","G_285")

BoxP <- rbind(do.call(rbind,Lkd),ULkd)

psplit <- ggplot(BoxP, aes(x = ind,y = values)) + 
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = 1,outlier.size = 1,lwd = 0.3) +
  facet_wrap(~ Group, scale = "free_y", ncol=1, labeller = labeller(Group = Group.labs)) +
  labs(x="Target variables",y="Pre-treated variable intensity") +
  theme_light()+
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(face="bold", size = 12, margin = margin(10,0,0,0)),
        axis.title.y = element_text(face="bold", size = 12, margin = margin(0,10,0,0)),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, angle = 0, vjust = 0.5),
        strip.text = element_text(size = 10, face = "bold"),
        legend.position = "none",
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
psplit
```

*Figure 4: Inter-variability and intra-variability of GCMS variables, several large seizures were selected to visualise the intra-variability*

Through this criterion it was decided to only exclude variables which exhibited a larger intra-variability and a smaller inter-variability, as they would only provide minimal discrimination between specimens; this included variable 04 (i.e. V04).


**(3) Correlation of variables**  
The correlation between variables was evaluated through Rho Spearman correlation coefficients and respective p-values, the correlation between all variables can be seen in Figure 5. It should be noted that a correlation coefficient above an absolute value of 0.7 is generally considered to be strong [5].
```{r}
M = cor(GCMS, method = "spearman")
corrplot <- ggcorrplot(M, method = "square", type = "upper", outline.col = "white", lab = TRUE, 
                       p.mat = ggcorrplot::cor_pmat(M, method = "spearman"), insig = "blank",
                       colors = c("#6D9EC1", "white", "#E46726")) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, angle = 0, vjust = 0.5),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
corrplot
```

*Figure 5: Rho Spearman correlation coefficients between GCMS variables*

Of the correlations which are statistically significant none of the correlation values are above an absolute value of 0.7. It was decided to not remove any variables considering the results of this criterion. 

In summary, it was decided to only remove V04 from subsequent analysis due to the results of the second criterion.
```{r}
# Extracting the chosen target variables for subsequent analysis
GCMS_TV <- GCMS %>% select(!V04)
```

#### **Optimisation of the linked and unlinked specimen populations:**
It was discovered that there was a large intra-variability between the MA specimens, which caused a large overlap between the linked and unlinked distributions. For this reason, it was decided to test several rules for defining the two populations (PR) to see how they would affect their separation. The rules are defined as follows:

Rule|Linked Population|Unlinked Population
-|-|-
R1|specimens from the same seizure|specimens from different seizures
R2|specimens from the same seizure, which contained two to ten specimens|seizures with only one specimen
R3|specimens from the same seizure, primary route, precursor and precursor route|specimens from different seizures and specimen pairs are excluded if they have the same primary route, precursor or precursor route
R4|specimens from the same seizure, which contained two to ten specimens, and specimen pairs must have the same primary route, precursor and precursor route|specimens from different seizures and specimen pairs are excluded if they have the same primary route, precursor or precursor route

Following the same method applied to the GCMS dataset, the optimal values and respective ROC AUC for all three analytical techniques are as follows:
```{r}
OPT_VAL <- data.frame(
  Profile = c("GCMS","IRMS","CE"),
  PT = c(OPT_GCMS_PT, OPT_IRMS_PT, OPT_CE_PT),
  CM = c(OPT_GCMS_CM, OPT_IRMS_CM, OPT_CE_CM),
  PR = c(OPT_GCMS_PR, OPT_IRMS_PR, OPT_CE_PR),
  AUC = c(OPT_GCMS_AUC, OPT_IRMS_AUC, OPT_CE_AUC)
)

library(formattable)

formattable(OPT_VAL,
            align = c("l",rep("c", NCOL(OPT_VAL) - 1)),
            list(`Profile` = formatter("span", style = ~ style(color = "grey", font.weight = "bold")),
            `AUC` = color_tile("#DeF7E9", "#71CA97"))
            )
```


## Summary of results
In summary, it was found that the GC-MS data was the most discriminative out of the three analytical techniques. This was determined though the area under the ROC curve values for the optimised PT/CM/PR combination of each analytical technique. In short, those values were 0.980 for GC-MS via N4R/PCC/R4, 0.732 for IRMS via L/MAN/R2 and 0.545 for CE profiles via N4R/MAN/R3. 

Although all these profile types are useful individually (e.g. generate information relating to different parts of the manufacturing process) [1], they do not need to be acquired and used concurrently to obtain timely intelligence [6]. In a previous study, it was demonstrated that a single profiling technique could be prioritised to contribute more effectively to the generation of timely intelligence [6]. In this instance a similar result was obtained, it was shown that GC-MS could be prioritised ahead of IRMS and CE techniques.
